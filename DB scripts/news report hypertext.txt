<h2>Security Updates</h2>
<p>	The application now officially supports salted and hashed passwords in the database.
This was one of the most important things I wanted to get done before the website really started getting users.
The methods described here are fairly standard to my knowledge and should protect against attacks in case of 
an attacker getting a hold of the database contents. They would have to deploy a primary attack to get that in the
first place.<br/>
	The way it works is fairly simple. When you register an account, a random salt is generated. Then, that salt is
appended to your plaintext password. Finally, the salted password is put through the one-way SHA-256 hashing algorithm
and that is stored in the database. Your randomly generated salt (which has no connection to your actual password) is
also stored in the database. From then on, everytime you log in, your salt is retrieved, appended to your password and
then put through the hashing algorithm again. If the stored hashed password is equal to the newly calculated one, your
submitted password must be the one you originally submitted.
