Random Thoughts - 
	Weapons have different ranges, and AI should use them in appropriate circumstances. Power ups are used based on different needs. Exploration and Flag capture are assisted by the speed boost. Longevity of play / defending are assisted by ammo packs. Aggressive play is assisted by med packs to heal mid fight. If you have low health, looking for an alternate route is the best idea because you will avoid fights and might see a health pack. AI should be able to see the state of flags and power ups within 50(?) block range.
