- Component Architecture fixes
	- Character needs a way to inform database of player kills on death.
		- Perhaps just a way to send a message from a component to the game it's entity belongs to
		- The data would be the GameEventsEntity
		- Also look into Listener design pattern
	- health component
		- need new interface for HealingDealer
		- is wall (to determine if should use normal or multiplied damage).
	- There should be no subclass of Entity
	- HomeBasePositionComponent
		- A grid locked position component which has a function to return itself to its home position.
