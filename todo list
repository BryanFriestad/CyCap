- Component Architecture fixes
	- components need a way to call ComponentContainer.Send();
		- component should probably be an abstract class with "private ComponentContainer parent;"
	- health component
		- need new interface for HealingDealer
		- is wall (to determine if should use normal or multiplied damage).
	- There should be no subclass of Entity
	- collision components need member data: static, can be picked up.
		- explosion collision and projectile can share code: need a stopping power
